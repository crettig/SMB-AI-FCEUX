Github clones of MarI/O by SethBling

This version is modified with 2 changes from
sethbling's code.
1) Added a function to scan find out whether or not the game
was in a "normal" state, which essentially just means that Mario
is running around on a level and not in a pipe, falling down a 
flagpole. etc. If mario was not in a normal state, the timeout is
reset.
2) The second change was to add .5 to the fitness of genome 
for every frame that Mario was not in a normal state. This way
a genome can be encouraged to move onto the next level.

Got the Ram values from
https://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.:RAM_map

Also Took the port of FCEUX for Sethbling over Bizhawk as I found FCEUX to be much faster

MarI/O is a program made of neural networks and genetic algorithms that kicks butt at Super Mario World.
